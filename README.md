[**Employee Summary**](https://github.com/ryanbrowne360/10_Employee_Summary)

Description:

This application is designed so that the user can create a team of employees using the command line with node js. It will then render an HTML page with the information gathered via the command line prompting. This application uses javascript classes to easily update information specific to the individual employees based on a predefined data set with predefined methods.

Installation:

In order to install and deploy this application, you need to have nodejs installed in your computer. [Click Here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to download it on your computer. You then need to download the develop folder in this github repository. Access this same directory through your terminal, and then type "node app.js". This will run your application. Also, if you want to run the tests, you simply type "npm run test" from the same directory.

Usage:

When the user opens the application in their command line, they are presented with a series of questions that are in a specific order. It will ask details that are relevant to each employee. It will then render that information to an easy to read HTML page once the prompts are complete.
